kernel-package
==============

We do not seem to be in a top level linux kernel source directory tree. Since we are trying to make a kernel package, that does not make sense.  Please change directory to a top level linux kernel source directory, and try again. (If I am wrong, and this is indeed a top level linux kernel source directory, then I have gotten sadly out of date with current kernels, and you should upgrade kernel-package)
